   abstract = {This article studies the effect of women's cabinet representation on public health policy outcomes. Based on a large sample of countries in the year 2000, the analysis shows that an increase in the share of women in cabinet is associated with an increase in public health spending. There is also an indication of a decrease in the gender gap in life expectancies in places with higher cabinet representation of women. The endogeneity of women's cabinet representation is accounted for by using the share of daughters that a national leader parents as an instrument. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Assuming that the observed gender differentials were caused by women's inclinations toward honesty and the common good, both studies advocated increased female participation in government to combat corruption. This study argues that the observed association between gender and corruption is spurious and mainly caused by its context, liberal democracy -- a political system that promotes gender equality and better governance. Data favor this "fairer system" thesis.},

Human capital and individual assets at the time of marriage are used as proxy measures for bargaining power. In all four countries, we reject the unitary model as a description of household behaviour, but fail to reject the hypothesis that households are Pareto-efficient. In Bangladesh and South Africa, women's assets increase expenditure shares on education, while in Ethiopia it is men's assets that have this effect. These increases have different implications for boys and girls across countries, however.},

Drawing on a national household survey from the Cote d'Ivoire, we find that raising women's share of cash income increases the budget share of food, and reduces the budget shares of alcohol and cigarettes. These effects are robust to changes in functional form, are reflected in reduced form estimates and concur with results obtained by examining single sex households.},

   abstract = {Feminist scholars suggest that improving the quality of life of individuals living in nations around the world may be more readily achieved by increasing women's political power and by reorienting public-policy priorities, than by focusing primarily on economic growth. These considerations raise the question of which characteristics of societies are associated with the quality of life of the people in those societies. Here, we address this issue empirically by statistically analyzing cross-national data. We assess the effects of gender equality in the political sphere, as well as a variety of other factors, on the subjective well-being of nations, as indicated by average self-reported levels of life satisfaction. We find that people report the highest levels of life satisfaction in nations where women have greater political representation, where military spending is low, and where health care spending is high, controlling for a variety of other factors. GDP per capita, urbanization, and natural resource exploitation are not clearly associated with life satisfaction. These findings suggest that nations may be able to improve the subjective quality of life of people without increasing material wealth or natural resource consumption by increasing gender equality in politics and changing public spending priorities. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Specifically, we investigate the relationship between female parliamentarism and forest cover change. Based on annual data from more than 176 countries between 1990 and 2015, the estimates suggest that the proportion of women in parliament has a significant U-shaped association with per capita forest cover. In particular, the nation-states with a critical mass of female legislators above 38 % should experience increases in per capita forest cover.},
